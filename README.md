my sett up instructions 

Open your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Spring Tool Suite (STS).
Create a new project and name it according to your preferences.
Set up your project using the appropriate build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle).
Step 2: Create Package Structure

Create packages for different layers of your application. Common layers include controller, service, dao, entity, and errorhandling.
Step 3: Create Entry Point

Within the controller package, create a class that serves as the entry point of your application. This class can be annotated with @SpringBootApplication.
Step 4: Define Interfaces

For each layer (controller, service, and dao), create an interface for each class you'll implement. These interfaces will define the contract for each class.
Annotate your interfaces with @Repository, @Service, and @RestController respectively.
Step 5: Modify OpenAPI Documentation

In the Controller Interface, use annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc., to define your API operations.
Modify the OpenAPI Documentation using annotations like @ApiOperation to specify the correct HTTP status codes for each operation.
Step 6: Implement Simplest Entities

Start with the simplest entities that have no dependencies on other entities.
For each entity, create a class in the entity package and annotate it with @Entity.
Define attributes using annotations like @Id, @GeneratedValue, @Column, etc.
Step 7: Implement CRUD Operations

In the dao package, create classes that implement the interfaces defined earlier.
Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for each entity using methods like save, findById, delete, etc.
Step 8: One-to-Many Relationship

Choose two entities that will participate in a one-to-many relationship (e.g., Artist and Albums).
Define the relationship in the entities using annotations like @ManyToOne and @OneToMany.
Step 9: Many-to-Many Relationship

Choose two entities that will participate in a many-to-many relationship (e.g., Song and Playlist).
Create an intermediary table/entity to represent this relationship.
Use annotations like @ManyToMany and @JoinTable to establish the relationship.
Step 10: Implement Relationship CRUD

Extend your CRUD operations to include the newly established relationships.
Implement methods to add, remove, or update related entities in the relationships.
Step 11: Testing Your API

Use Swagger to test your API endpoints. Ensure that the OpenAPI Documentation annotations you added earlier accurately reflect the expected responses for each operation.
Alternatively, you can use tools like Postman to test your API.
